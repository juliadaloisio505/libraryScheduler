# Library Scheduler 

# Project Inspiration

This project was inspired when I set out to read the novel Don Quxiote - which is over 950 pages long! Since I obtained the book from my university library, I wanted to calculate how many pages I would need to read each day to finish the book by the due date. And thus, library scheduler was born!

# How it Works

I implemented the project using React JS, all implementation details can be found in the source code. I also uploaded the React App hosted by github. The website can be found here: https://juliadaloisio505.github.io/libraryScheduler/ 

# Final Remarks

I sincerely hope that anyone who would find this project even remotely useful will use the web app to help them plan their reading schedules. And to ultimately achieve their reading goals!
